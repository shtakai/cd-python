# Part I
#
# Create a program that prints all the odd numbers from 1 to 1000. Use the for loop and don't use any array to do this exercise.

for value in range(1,1000):
    if value % 2 != 0:
        print value


# Part II

# Create another program that prints all the multiples of 5 from 5 to 1,000,000.

for value in range(5,10000000):
    if value % 5 == 0:
        print value
